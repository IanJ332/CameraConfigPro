**Ⅴ. How to Use:**

1. **Select Your Mode**: Choose the desired photography mode from our collection.
2. **Apply the Configuration**: Follow the step-by-step instructions to apply the configuration to your native camera app.

**From the developer**: I'll slowly poop out instructions later, so if you don't know how to install the software or how to import configuration files, try searching for tutorials online. 

**Ⅵ. Additional Information:**

- All config files in this repository are based on BigKaKa's AGC9.2.14_V11.0.apk available [HERE](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/), which is a safe and stable version.
- The configurations were developed using a Samsung S23 ULTRA and a Leica D-Lux 8 camera.
- For any issues or suggestions, please create a discussion or an issue on [github](https://github.com/IanJ332/CameraConfigPro/issues).
- These configs are compiled from various internet sources and do not possess full copyright. If there is any infringement, I apologize and will promptly remove the content upon request.
- The motivation for this project was to replicate the parameters of my Leica camera on my phone when I forget to bring it while traveling.
- There is no guarantee that all phones will produce different photos with the same parameters, and I debugged these files as much as possible based on different camera algorithms and the varying quality of the sensors.
- The configuration will adjust the aperture, shutter, ISO, focal length, depth of field, exposure, and automatically optimize the image when generating the image, please note that due to all configurations of the original image secondary processing, some details and quality may be lost. For high-demand professional photography, filters may not achieve the desired effect and quality!
- Contributions are welcome! If you have a new mode or an improvement to an existing configuration, please feel free to submit a pull request.
- Your feedback is invaluable. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for new features, please open an issue on GitHub.

### Ⅶ. Brief Explanation of the Config's Purpose(letter to you)
</p>
The core components of this Config are developed by Google. Generally, the ported versions available online do not modify the stylization settings (libpatch); instead, they use Google's default `.so` files. As a result, mainstream ported versions like LMC, AGC, and Shamim are largely similar in nature.

For my own device (S23), I have made several modifications and added many features that were not present in the original V9 version, mostly in terms of aesthetics. For example, I have integrated Leica and Fujifilm logos. However, I am not releasing these resources publicly **to avoid any potential issues**.

Currently, my development progress is slow due to the time required for adaptation, modifications, and testing. My ultimate goal is to achieve fully automated operation, allowing AI to take over all tasks. This way, regardless of upgrades in lens modules, changes in image sensors, or even CPU iterations, AI could handle everything automatically. Additionally, by incorporating user feedback, AI could refine and optimize previous files.

I have a personal preference for the vivid modes of Hasselblad, Fujifilm, and Leica. I encourage everyone to actively provide feedback and join the discussion to improve this project together.

Finally, let me quote a poem I deeply appreciate:

> _"To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life. "_

Thank you for using, viewing, and providing feedback. **May you find your own roll of film #25 in life.**
