**Additional Information:**

- All config files in this repository are based on BigKaKa's AGC9.2.14_V11.0.apk available [HERE](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/), which is a safe and stable version.
- The configurations were developed using a Samsung S23 ULTRA and a Leica D-Lux 8 camera.
- For any issues or suggestions, please create a discussion or an issue on [github](https://github.com/IanJ332/CameraConfigPro/issues).
- These configs are compiled from various internet sources and do not possess full copyright. If there is any infringement, I apologize and will promptly remove the content upon request.
- The motivation for this project was to replicate the parameters of my Leica camera on my phone when I forget to bring it while traveling.
- There is no guarantee that all phones will produce different photos with the same parameters, and I debugged these files as much as possible based on different camera algorithms and the varying quality of the sensors.
- The configuration will adjust the aperture, shutter, ISO, focal length, depth of field, exposure, and automatically optimize the image when generating the image, please note that due to all configurations of the original image secondary processing, some details and quality may be lost. For high-demand professional photography, filters may not achieve the desired effect and quality!
